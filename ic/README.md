# Eventverse

Eventverse is an AI-powered event management agent built on the Internet Computer (ICP). It leverages **ASI1 AI API** for natural language understanding and **ICP canisters** for managing events. Users can query events, get event details, generate payment links, and interact via both REST API and chat protocols.

---

## Features

- **Create events** on ICP canisters.
- **Retrieve events** with optional pagination (`limit` & `offset`).
- **Get event details** by ID.
- **Generate payment links** for events.
- **Retrieve canister address** for the event management system.
- **AI-powered chat interface** for natural language queries.
- **REST API endpoint** for chat queries.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- `.env` file with the following key:
  ```text
  ASI1_API_KEY=your_asi1_api_key_here
````

* Installed Python packages:

  ```bash
  pip install requests python-dotenv uagents-core uagents
  ```

---

## Configuration

* **ASI1 API**

  * API key is loaded from `.env`.
  * Base URL: `https://api.asi1.ai/v1`.
* **ICP Canister**

  * Canister ID: `w7lou-c7777-77774-qaamq-cai`.
  * Local testing URL: `http://127.0.0.1:4943`.

---

## Available Tools / Functions

1. **create\_event**

   * Create a new event.
   * Required: `name`, `date`, `location`, `price`.
   * Optional: `capacity`.

2. **get\_events**

   * Retrieve a list of events.
   * Optional: `limit`, `offset`.
   * Prices are returned in ETH.

3. **get\_event\_by\_id**

   * Fetch details of a specific event by ID.

4. **payment**

   * Generate a payment link for an event by ID.

5. **canister\_address**

   * Returns the ICP canister address.

---

## Usage

### REST API

Start the agent:

```bash
python main.py
```

**Endpoint:** `POST /chat`

**Request Body Example:**

```json
{
  "message": "Show me the upcoming events"

If you want, I can also create a **more beginner-friendly README** that includes **diagrams of the architecture**, showing how ASI1, ICP canister, and the agent interact. This is useful if you plan to share the project publicly.  

Do you want me to make that version too?
